Variadic functions, A variadic function is a function in programming that can accept a variable number of arguments. It allows the function to take any number of arguments of any type, making it very flexible and powerful. In C and C++, the standard way to define a variadic function is by using the ellipsis (...) in the function declaration to indicate that the function can take a variable number of arguments. The standard library provides the printf() and scanf() functions as examples of variadic functions in C. The printf() function takes a format string followed by any number of arguments, which are used to replace the placeholders in the format string. The scanf() function takes a format string and a variable number of pointers to variables, which are used to store the input values matched by the format string. Variadic functions can be very useful when writing functions that need to be able to handle a variable number of arguments. However, they also have some limitations and drawbacks, such as the lack of type safety and the potential for undefined behavior if the arguments are not used correctly. As such, they should be used with care and only when necessary.
