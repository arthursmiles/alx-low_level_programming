Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. Instead of declaring individual variables such as number0, number1, you declare one array varible such as numbers and use numbers[0] to represent individual variables.
