malloc() is a standard library function in C and C++ programming languages that is used to dynamically allocate a block of memory of a specified size during runtime. It stands for memory allocation. Syntax: void* malloc(size_t size)'. Here, the size parameter is the number of bytes of memory that you want to allocate. The function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block. For example, the following code allocates a block of memory that can hold 10 integers: int* myArray = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * 10); Note that malloc() does not initialize the memory that it allocates. Therefore, the contents of the allocated memory are undefined and may contain garbage values. If you need the allocated memory to be initialized to a specific value, you can use the calloc() function instead of malloc()' Also, when you are done using the allocated memory, it is important to free it using the free() function, like this: free(myArray); If you don't free the allocated memory, it can cause memory leaks, which can lead to performance issues and instability. It is worth noting that malloc() can also return a NULL pointer if the requested memory cannot be allocated, for example if there is not enough available memory. Therefore, it's a good practice to check the return value of malloc() before using the allocated memory.
