A function pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of a function. It allows a program to dynamically invoke a function at runtime by calling the function through its associated function pointer. Function pointers are commonly used in C and C++ to implement callbacks, dynamic dispatch, and polymorphism. They can also be used to create reusable code that can be dynamically linked and loaded at runtime, allowing for greater modularity and flexibility in software design. Function pointers are a powerful and versatile feature of the C and C++ programming languages. At their core, they allow a program to store the memory address of a function and then invoke that function dynamically at runtime, providing a mechanism for implementing dynamic dispatch, polymorphism, and other advanced programming techniques. To understand how function pointers work, it's important to understand a little bit about how functions are stored in memory. In C and C++, functions are treated as a special type of variable, just like integers or floats. When you define a function, the compiler generates machine code for that function and stores it in a specific location in memory. This location is determined at compile time and is typically fixed for the duration of the program's execution. When you call a function in C or C++, the compiler generates instructions that tell the computer to jump to the memory location where the function's code is stored and start executing the code from there. The memory address of the function's code is determined at compile time and is hard-coded into the executable file that's generated by the compiler.
