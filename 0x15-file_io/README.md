In C, File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files. This process involves opening a file, performing read/write operations on the file, and then closing the file. The basic steps involved in performing file I/O in C are:

1. Open the file: This involves using the fopen() function to open the file in the desired mode (read, write, append, binary, etc.).

2. Perform read/write operations: Once the file is open, you can use functions such as fscanf() and fprintf() to read and write data to/from the file, respectively.

3. Close the file: After all read/write operations have been performed, you should close the file using the fclose() function.

It is important to handle errors and check for the success of each file operation. Additionally, C provides a set of standard I/O functions that can be used for file I/O operations, such as fgets(), fputs(), fread(), and fwrite(). Proper memory management and error handling are important to ensure safe and efficient file I/O operations.
